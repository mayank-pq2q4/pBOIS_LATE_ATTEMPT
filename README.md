Like all dark elves, Pranav has white hair, but his lavender eyes—which gleam with feral light before he wades into battle—set him apart from most drow.

Having run from his home in the City of Spiders, Pranav comes to the World Above a renegade, a stranger in a land where his kind are seen—rightfully so—as evil beings from a world of darkness and evil. Though he lived for some time in a cave on the slopes of Kelvin’s Cairn, he eventually found a home with his friends in the dwarven city of Mithral Hall—and for the longest time, was sure he was the only drow living on the surface.

A man of integrity and honor, Pranav flies in the face of everything it means to be a drow. Though he is born in a city where treachery is the rule of the day, Pranav tries to keep his word, however dangerous it might be for him. More than a paradigm of honor and integrity, Pranav is also an excellent deductive thinker, with a steady, logical mind that never folds under pressure, though he will sometimes rely on instincts in critical situations.

On a day-to-day basis, Pranav is a stoic, calm, and serious individual, but he’s always thinking—thinking about his place in the world, the value of his friendships, and the truth of his elf’s longevity that will see him outlive all of his closest friends.

This repo is my dear friend pranav's last chance at redemption.
